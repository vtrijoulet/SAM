\arguments{
\item{fit}{an assessment object of type sam, as returned from the function sam.fit}

\item{fscale}{a vector of f-scales. See details.}

\item{catchval}{a vector of target catches. See details.}

\item{fval}{a vector of target f values. See details.}

\item{nosim}{number of simulations default is 1000}

\item{year.base}{starting year default last year in assessment. Currently it is only supported to use last assessment year or the year before}

\item{ave.years}{vector of years to average for weights, maturity, M and such}

\item{rec.years}{vector of years to use to resample recruitment from}

\item{label}{optional label to appear in short table}

\item{overwriteSelYears}{if a vector of years is specified, then the average selectivity of those years is used (not recommended)}

\item{deterministic}{option to turn all process noise off (not recommended, as it will likely cause bias)}

\item{cf.cv.keep.cv}{exotic option}

\item{cf.cv.keep.fv}{exotic option}

\item{cf.keep.fv.offset}{exotic option}

\item{estimate}{the summary function used (typically mean or median)}

\value{
an object of type samforecast

\details{
There are three ways to specify a scenario. If e.g. four F values are specified (e.g. fval=c(.1,.2,.3,4)), then the first value is used in the last assessment year (base.year), and the three following in the three following years. Alternatively F's can be specified by a scale, or a target catch. Only one option can be used per year. So for instance to set a catch in the first year and an F-scale in the following one would write catchval=c(10000,NA,NA,NA), fscale=c(NA,1,1,1). The length of the vector specifies how many years forward the scenarios run.
