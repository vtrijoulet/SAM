\title{rmvnorm helper function to draw multivariate normal samples}
\usage{
rmvnorm(n = 1, mu, Sigma)

rmvnorm(n = 1, mu, Sigma)
}
\arguments{
\item{n}{the number of samples.}

\item{mu}{the mean vector.}

\item{Sigma}{a positive-definite symmetric matrix specifying the covariance matrix.}

\item{n}{the number of samples.}

\item{mu}{the mean vector.}

\item{Sigma}{a positive-definite symmetric matrix specifying the covariance matrix.}
}
\value{
If n = 1 a vector of the same length as mu, otherwise an n by length(mu) matrix with one sample in each row.

If n = 1 a vector of the same length as mu, otherwise an n by length(mu) matrix with one sample in each row.
